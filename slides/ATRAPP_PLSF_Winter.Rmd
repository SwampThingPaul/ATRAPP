name: objectives

## Objective(s)/Goal(s)

* Examine total and dissolved nutrients during winter in a seasonally ice-covered lake focusing on the link between inorganic nutrient changes and ice duration (similar to Powers et al. 2017)

* ??

## Hypotheses

* Due to changes to the physical structure of the lake and the constraints that lake ice places on energy and material fluxes (Cavaliere et al 2021) concentrations of dissolved inorganic nutrients (i.e. DIN and SRP) will be greater in the winter/ice period; 

* Inorganic  nutrient accumulation rates will be sensitive to regional and local climate metrics (i.e. FDD, PDO, etc.) resulting in shorter periods of ice cover and therefore less time to accumulate .

* El Nino-Southern Oscillation events affect climatic conditions in the region (Shabbar et al 1997)
* Impact of global warming is expressed mainly in winte
* Small shallow lakes can be susceptible to changes in winter hydrology, water level, and associated ecological interactions (McGowan et al 2005)
* Precipitation patterns in Canada are influenced by shorter timescale teleconnections such as the PDO

* Winter mean air temp vs year: $\tau$ = 0.38 $\rho$-value < 0.01
* FDD vs year: $\tau$ = -0.44 $\rho$-value < 0.01

```{r,out.width="100%",fig.align="center",fig.cap="Ice on/off dates for PLSF" }

knitr::include_graphics("./plots/winter/PLSF_IceCover.png")
```

Generally, ice on/off dates are moving to the top left corner of the plot suggesting later ice-on dates and earlier ice-off dates. But there is some variability in this limited time-series. 
* Could remote sensing data be used to fill in the data gaps?

```{r,out.width="80%",fig.align="center",fig.cap="Comparison of ice coverage duration" }

knitr::include_graphics("./plots/winter/PLSF_IceCover_dur.png")
```

When comparing more recent data to the reference period of 1975 - 1977 (and 1982) the median ice cover duration has declined (not statistically significant) and become more variable. This could suggests a more dynamic/variable climate.

* Lake Outlet comparison of NO_x_ is consistent with Powers et al 2017 indicating an accumulation of NO_x_ during the ice-cover period.
* But we also see an increase in NO_x_ concentration from the watershed via Lake Inlet. 
  * Denitrification reactions are slow down in winter? (changes in loading?)

* Limited period of record (2016 - 2021)
* Obviously algal pigments decline during Ice period (limited light attenuation, below optimum temp, etc.)

* Inlet and Outlet driven by different processes.

* Might need to evaluate discharge values to provide some clarity?
  * Use monthly FWM concentrations vs PDO to remove the effect of run-off/snow melt dilution? 
  * Negative PDO climate has a tendency to bring above normal precipitation  
  
* SRP correlation driven by non-detects
